# Module Inquiry 4

## Questions

1. Link to the pull request you are most proud of.

    https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Labs27-C-Citrics-DS/pull/5

2. Why are you proud of this feature? What was difficult about its implementation?
    The part of the feature I am proud of is the webscraper that compiled the data for our initial database.
    I am proud of this feature because it was able to be a large part of our data collection for current information
    and it was also something that I told my team I would be able to show them how to do resulting in them not shying away
    from using it themselves, which is what occured by another team member fleshing it out some more and created a loop to grab
    the data for our list of cities.
    The difficult part about it's implementation was sorting through the html code of the webpage to figure out how to get the exact data that we
    were looking for in a format that would work for multiple pages on the website we were scraping from
3. How does this feature help the user?
    It helps the user by providing current statistics on the city they are viewing

4. Think about the process of delivering this feature: from ideation, to scoping, to pairing, to testing. Knowing what you know now, what would you change about the way in which you delivered this feature? 

    I think the main fallback of the feature is that the naming of the cities from different sources is not consistent so it makes matching up data from different sources
    a more complicated process than initially perceived. I believe a redo on the implementation of the webscraper would consist of getting our more difficult to obtain data
    and then scraping a website for the common data that is a little easier to come by.
