## Questions

1. What feature did you work on with a teammate up to this point in the sprint?

    The feature I worked on with a teammate was the webscraper for gathering data from webpages.

2. When were you the driver? When were you the navigator? Which role did you prefer and why?
    During the initial part of the webscraper I was the driver. The other members were a little unconfident in the utility and setup of the scraper
    so I set up the initial code for it and a few attributes to grab for each city and afterwards, Chelsea fine tuned what the search returned for each city
    and then created a list to loop through each webpage and get the data for each of them then store it in a csv.

    I preferred to be the navigator when pair programming because it lets me see a better picture of how the other person
    likes to code and also it is a great way to learn from them as well which I feel like applies to both sides.

3. What was difficult about being a navigator?
    The most difficult thing about being the navigator is that you don't know what the other person doesn't know so it seems easy to either gloss over things
    the other person doesn't understand or move too slowly for the other person and get them disinterested or nonresponsive.

4. How will you adjust your pair programming behavior in the future?
    In the future I might be more inquisitive as to why they are doing what they are doing to possibly give some additional insight into
    what the other person is thinking and being able to learn more from them. Also, asking if they understand what I'm doing and why and whatever else I can
    do to be reassuring that if they jump in as their role of navigator, I'm willing to listen to the idea they have.
