# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. **(For full-time only)** What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?


2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.

    * Compare cities in proximity to the one searched
    * Compare up to 3 cities at once.
    * Showing the population, weather, and job industry for each city searched.
3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    * My favorite user story is being able to search multiple cities at a time to see what the average weather is like.

    * To do this, We need to be able to query data from our database when requested and get the average weather stats
       for that particular city.

    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
        * I think that our team figured out the vast majority of features that would need to be implimented along with an idea
           at minimum of how.
        * The main challenge I saw during the task breakdown seems to come from team members not really understanding what the other
           team members jobs' are.
4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
   * One of the things that I saw used often that our team did not impliment was the different sections of planning based on which user was being considered when creating the user story
      such as the difference between what a user would be doing if they came to the app as a consumer or supplier.
   * The only other thing I would change from our process is how far down the "assignments" went. I feel like quite a few of our assignments for our Trello board
      were still able to be broken down a little bit further so when you ask someone to go take care of a certain assignment, it wouldn't be a question of which one of these
      markers in the assignment do you want done.
