# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. **(For full-time only)** What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?


2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.

    * Compare cities in proximity to the one searched
    * Compare up to 3 cities at once.
    * Showing the population, weather, and job industry for each city searched.
3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    * My favorite user story is being able to search multiple cities at a time to see what the average weather is like.

    * To do this, We need to be able to query data from our database when requested and get the average weather stats
       for that particular city.

    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
        * I think that our team figured out the vast majority of features that would need to be implimented along with an idea
           at minimum of how.
        * The main challenge I saw during the task breakdown seems to come from team members not really understanding what the other
           team members jobs' are.
4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
